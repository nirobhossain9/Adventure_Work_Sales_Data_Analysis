üöÄ Excited to share another one of my recent projects!
üí´Data Visualization Project: Adventure Works Sales

# Power Bi Dashboard: https://lnkd.in/gjVameYy

I created this Dynamic Dashboard of Adventure Works Sales analysis using Power BI. This interactive dashboard provides insights into Total order, Turnover, Profit, Profit-margin & Return Rate (%) while specificizing by a range of Year, Product Categories and Continent.

‚ú®I'm constantly in awe of Power BI's capacity to efficiently show complicated data and offer useful insights!

Here i took this Dummy data from Kaggle developed an interactive dashboard to get a valuable KPI and Insights about the sales. 

# Key insights:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The turnover rate for the current month (CM) is 3.31% higher than that of the previous month (PM). However, the return rate is down 1.91% and the CM turnover is down 0.88% compared to the PM turnover. Accessories are the most popular product category.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Australia had the highest turnover ($7.4M) in the whole region.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Customers from professional occupations outnumber those from other professions, and 57% of customers are from high-income categories.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Monthly sales are nearly closed to the targets (10% higher than the preceding month) by order, turnover, and profit.


# Recommendation: </br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏èYou can offer customers or make a discount on your product to engage customer more and fill up your target.</br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏èAnd list up those customers who purchased more and try to make a special offer for them.
